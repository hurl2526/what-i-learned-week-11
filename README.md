## **Day 38** 

went over hw

went over HW

Started on .sort

similar to map except changes the order

basically saying if -1, don't swap order of two value.  

If 1 swap two values.  
  
If 0 keep the same.  

Goes through two values at a time until no more swapping 

const arr = [...oldArr] is the standard way to copy old array when going to .sort without changing original array. can also do newArr = oldArr.slice()


## **Day 39**

Function stuff})
